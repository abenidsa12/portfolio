about_me:
  - Hey there, I'm Abeni!
  - A Biologist/Scientist by heart, a team coordinator by profession, and a creative soul always in motion. Whether I'm unraveling the mysteries of the gut microbiome in burying beetles, orchestrating events and managing logistics with precision, or playing a beautiful tone on the piano, I thrive at the intersection of science, creativity and curiosity.
  - With a Masters in Biology from the RPTU in Kaiserslautern, Germany, I've explored several topics from burying beetles to leaf-cutting ants to microbial secrets of migratory birds at Wadden sea. But these days, you will find me organizing projects, working closely with scientists from the fields of computer science, mathematics, psychology and computational neuroscience, supporting them in their research and teaching activities, handling budgets and ensuring everything flows seamlessly in my role as a Team Assistant.
  - Beyond work, I'm a pianist, singer, artist (I like to draw and paint), and an adventure seeker who loves travelling and capturing moments through photography.
  - I believe life is a balance of logic and creativity, planning and spontaneity, research and rhythm.
  - Let's connect! Whether it's about science, project management, or discovering the best travel spots in Germany (and Europe), I'm always up for a great conversation.

monologue_title: Team Assistant, Project Coordinator & Molecular Biologist

monologue:
  - My undergraduate studies laid the foundation for my understanding of biological systems, evolutionary processes, and ecological interactions. With my interest for research, I further pursued a Master of Science in Zoology in India and a Masters of Biology in Germany. This degree deepened my expertise in Molecular Ecology, Microbiome Research and Species Interactions. My Master thesis was hands-on experience in genetic analysis, data visualization, and experimental research-giving me an edge in scientific research and computational biology. While science has been a key part of my life, my extracurricular experiences have shaped my ability to communicate, lead and adapt in diverse environments.
