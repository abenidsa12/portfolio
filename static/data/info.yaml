about_me:
  - I am Abeni John Dsa, a biologist with a strong background in molecular biology, ecology, and zoology. My academic journey has been shaped by a Master of Science in Biology with a specialization in Ecology from RPTU Kaiserslautern, Germany, and a Master of Science in Zoology from Savitribai Phule Pune University, India. My research experience includes studying microbiome transmission in burying beetles, analyzing herbivory pressure across ecological habitats, and investigating the microbial communities of the Wadden Sea.
  - With expertise in molecular techniques such as DNA/RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and sequencing, alongside statistical analysis using Python and R, I enjoy exploring complex biological questions. My professional experience spans roles in research, teaching, and project coordination, including behavioral studies on leaf-cutting ants and administrative work supporting sustainability projects.
  - Beyond science, I have a deep appreciation for the arts and music. I play the piano, sing, and engage in painting and digital drawing. My love for cultural and historical exploration fuels my curiosity, both in research and in life.

monologue:
  - I began my academic journey with a Bachelor of Science in Zoology at Savitribai Phule Pune University, India. This program laid the foundation for my understanding of biological systems, evolutionary processes, and ecological interactions.
  - Building upon this foundation, I pursued a Master of Science in Zoology, where I conducted computational research on the Opsin 2 protein in desert locusts, leveraging molecular modeling and bioinformatics techniques. Subsequently, I expanded my expertise with another Master of Science in Biology at RPTU Kaiserslautern, Germany, specializing in molecular ecology and microbiome research.
  - My master's thesis at the University of Freiburg focused on the genetic and environmental factors shaping gut microbiome transmission in burying beetles. This experience honed my skills in DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing, and statistical analysis using R and Python.
  - Beyond my academic research, I have explored ecological and molecular studies in diverse environments, including herbivory pressure in different ecological habitats and microbial communities in the Wadden Sea. My interdisciplinary approach allows me to integrate molecular techniques with ecological analysis to address complex biological questions.
